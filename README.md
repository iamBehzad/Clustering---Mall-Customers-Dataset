# Clustering-Mall-Customers-Dataset:
This project uses a dataset related to Market Basket Analysis. The scenario is that you own a supermarket and have basic information about your customers, including customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending. The spending score is assigned based on defined parameters such as customer behavior and purchase data.

The project starts with visualizing, performing exploratory data analysis and storytelling, and completing data preprocessing on the dataset. Following this, the data is clustered using k-means and DBSCAN clustering methods.

The project is available on GitHub and provides an end-to-end guide on how to perform market basket analysis with Python. It provides a helpful example for data scientists interested in understanding clustering algorithms and the market basket analysis.
